Filter type, specified as one of the following:
Filter type, specified as one of the following:

'low' specifies a lowpass filter with cutoff frequency Wn. 'low' is the default for scalar Wn.

'high' specifies a highpass filter with cutoff frequency Wn.

'bandpass' specifies a bandpass filter of order 2n if Wn is a two-element vector. 'bandpass' is the default when Wn has two elements.

'stop' specifies a bandstop filter of order 2n if Wn is a two-element vector.
